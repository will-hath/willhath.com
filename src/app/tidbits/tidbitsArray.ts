Your mouth gives most of the range, but because of how tubes work, you're only able to hit the harmonics, which decrease in spacing as they increase. So, for a "C" trumpet, you can (in order) play a low C, a middle C, a middle G, a high C, a high E, a high A flat, etc. If you want to hit the notes in between, you have to use the valves, which you control with your fingers. The effectively change the length of the trumpet tube by a fixed amount, which each correspond to a fixed decrease in pitch -- a half tone, a whole tone, or a minor third. By pressing them in combination, you can hit 8 ($2^{3}$) unique notes for each harmonic.`
