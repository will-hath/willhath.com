<p>After Robert Kennedy ceased it&#39;s operation as a prison, Alcatraz island was occupied by a group of Native Americans for 18 months, between November 1969 and June 1971. They legally justified this under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which stated that all land &quot;declared surplus&quot; should be returned to the indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>Redwoods, despite the name, are not actually very red. Their bark looks a lot like cedar — in bright lighting, a light brown, interspersed with patches of a dilute burnt orange. However, if you take a knife and peel back the bark from a bough, you’ll notice a light red layer in between the brown bark and the white wood. </p>

<p>In Legget (the town in Northern California where the 1 diverges from the 101), there is a redwood that you can drive your car through. Many decades ago, the people who owned the land cut an arch into it. The clearance is about 6’8”, and it costs $15. </p>

<p>The epic fantasy author Brandon Sanderson just released the 5th book in <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, his gargantuan 10-book series (which he clearly hopes will cement his legacy as the greatest epic fantasy writer since Robert Jordan, if not Tolkien). However, he will not release the 6th book for at least 9 more years. This is because he’s planning on writing them all together before releasing any of them, ostensibly to make sure the narrative is as tight as possible. I think it’s fun to try to figure when famous artists are worrying about their legacies. </p>

<p>Many roads in India (especially in the mountains) barely wide enough to support two-directional traffic. This poses a problem when the road goes around a turn, or if a portion of the road is washed out. Thus, in order to safely navigate corners, Indian drivers lay on their horns every time visibility is remotely obscured.</p>

<p>The original DTP (Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis) vaccine, was considered too dangerous for use in the USA in the late 1980s due to neurological side-effects, and was replaced by DTaP, which uses acellular components of Pertussis, rather than whole-cell. However, DTP is still widely used in developing countries. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a narrative in the USA that we have an obscene amount of national debt. But, if you compare our debt to GDP ratio to the rest of the world&#39;s 8 largest economies (China, UK, Italy, Japan, Germany, France, UK, India), ours is better than 2 of them, and is comparable to another 2. </p>

<p>Pathao, a Nepalese ride-sharing app, doesn&#39;t even try and algorithmically generate a ride fee. Instead, it&#39;s a fully free market, with riders proposing a payment for a ride, and drivers being free to accept any bids. This was likely just done because it&#39;s easier to implement, but an interesting benefit is that Pathao avoids negative PR from accusations of &quot;price gauging&quot; during peak times.</p>

<p>The reason the worlds second tallest mountain, K2, is named what it is, rather than some real name (Like Lhotse, Everest (aka Sagarmatar), Cho Oyu, Manaslu, etc) is that the locals didn’t know that it existed! It wasn’t visible from anywhere anyone would ever want to go. This is not true of any other mountains in the top 20. </p>

<p>If you use an email marketing service like Mailchimp, they&#39;re able to give you information on which people opened your email. The way they do this is by embedding a unique, tiny image address in each email, which your email client then tries to load when it renders the email. Mailchimp detects which image addresses got GET requests, and uses that to track who opened which emails. </p>

<p>In Oregon, in order to offset lost gas tax revenue, it costs more than twice as much to register an electric vehicle with the DMV than a gas-powered vehicle. There&#39;s also a penalty for vehicles that get better gas mileage.</p>
<h4>Saturday, Sep 28, 2024</h4>
<p>The stability of consumer gasoline has deteriorated significantly since the 1980s, from ~9 months to ~2 months. This is largely due to the introduction of ethanol(modern gasoline contains ~10%), which absorbs water from the atmosphere over time, causing fuel to become less stable/efficient. Ethanol is introduced because it causes less greenhouse gas emissions, and it is able to be manufactured from agricultural products (corn, sugarcane, etc) rather than drilled for like oil. </p>

<p><em>San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some Flowers in your Hair)</em>, by Scott McKenzie, was the anthem of the summer of love, and actually drove a bunch of people to come to San Francisco (rather than the correlation going the other way as I&#39;d assumed). </p>

<p>Trumpets seem complicated to play. There are two ways to alter the pitch -- with your mouth, and with the valves. Your mouth gives most of the range, but because of how tubes work, you&#39;re only able to hit the harmonics, which decrease in spacing as they increase. So, for a &quot;C&quot; trumpet, you can (in order) play a low C, a middle C, a middle G, a high C, a high E, a high A flat, etc. If you want to hit the notes in between, you have to use the valves, which you control with your fingers. The effectively change the length of the trumpet tube by a fixed amount, which each correspond to a fixed decrease in pitch -- a half tone, a whole tone, or a minor third. By pressing them in combination, you can hit 8 ($2^{3}$) unique notes for each harmonic. </p>

<p>When estimating the net worth of individuals, Forbes values stock held in private companies at 90 cents on the dollar. So if you own 10% of a company that&#39;s worth 10 billion, you&#39;re &quot;worth&quot; 900 million.</p>

<p>The Guinness in Guinness world records is the same Guinness as in Guinness beer. In order to write the first ever book, they reached out to experts in various fields. Instead of asking them for direct pieces of information, they stated facts that felt right, and experts eagerly stepped in to correct them. </p>

<p>Aluminum is much harder to weld than steel, primarily because it conducts heat faster, and has a lower melting point. This gives you a smaller &quot;window of workability&quot;.</p>

<p>New Hampshire is the only US state to have no laws requiring adults to wear seatbelts. However, in many other states (such as Massachusetts), it’s a “secondary offense”, which means you can’t get pulled over for not wearing one, but if you get pulled over for a primary infraction, you can get cited for not wearing a seatbelt.  </p>

<p>In economics, there’s this thing called the “productivity J curve”, where basically, after a new technology is discovered, “productivity” (as measured via GDP) will stagnate, because free capitol is being invested into the new technology (ie, building railroad lines, integrating AI infrastructure, etc). But then, once these shorter-term investments pay off, GPD rises faster again, overcoming the rate of decreased productivity. </p>

<p>There are two styles of cross country skiing. There’s “Classic”, where you mostly keep your skis parallel to each other, and mainly use your arms. Then there’s ”Skating”, where you point your toes outwards and drive yourself forwards by pushing your legs outwards. Classic is more intuitive, but generally requires better packed/more consistent snow.</p>

<p>The ideal strategy in Ticket to Ride is probably to hoard cards at the beginning of the game (higher locomotives/card average, and you preserve optionality as long as possible). Also, start with game with fairly few tickets, and make sure they all can be linked together. People usually undervalue the utility of just building lots of roads and going out of trains. Also, in the EU version, Palermo to Moscow is the best long-route since that part of the board is much less crowded.</p>

<p>Apparently most countries other than the USA have interest free investment accounts with <strong>no</strong> restrictions on what they can be used for (Canada has TFSA, UK has ISA). The limits are higher or comparable to in the USA. The USA has the Roth IRA, but that has strict limits on how you can withdraw from it, and is intended just for retirement. </p>
<h4>Thursday, Jan, 4 2024</h4>
<p>Estonia, Finland, and maybe a few other countries are all in the same free-market energy pricing scheme. Due to extremely cold temperatures as well as less supply (I assume Russia/Ukraine stuff), energy prices are now such that running a small space heater for one day would cost ~€150. God bless America, and her oil. </p>
