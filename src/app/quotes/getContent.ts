<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alone, at the end of a universe humming a tune</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole idea that when you fall you gotta get up is bullshit. The whole thing is a fall. A perpetual state of grasping in the dark. It&#39;s not about getting up, it&#39;s about stumbling in the right direction. It&#39;s the only true way to move forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day —that’s the hard part. But it does get easier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn&#39;t a search for meaning. It&#39;s to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you&#39;ll be dead.</p>
<p>There’s a star man, waiting in the sky
He’d like to come and meet us but he thinks he’d blow our minds</p>
<p>My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man&#39;s life?</p>
<p>there is no name you could call me would make me value your approval</p>
<p>There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel.
But it was an ending. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>blessed be the peacemakers, for they will be shot at from two sides</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth, even against the whole world, you were not mad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.</p>
<p>Fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid - the flood will bear you back to	the bank and set you safe on your feet again</p>
<p>above all, don’t lie to yourself.</p>
<p>Quite simple.
Be an example of humanity that is not disappointing</p>
<p>We take risks, we know we take them.
Therefore, when things come out against us, we have no cause for complaint.</p>
<p>Everyone remembers icarus, nobody remembers the other guy</p>
