<p>There&#39;s a lot more to partial derivatives than I realized. For example, for any three variables $x,y,z$ that are all functions of eachother
$$
\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y = -1
$$</p>

<p>The first primary use of Galileo’s discovery of the jovian moons was to redraw all of our maps! Since the Jovian eclipses happen very frequently, you can compare your local time to your global time (based off when the eclipse happened). </p>
<h4>Sunday, Feb 11, 2024</h4>
<p>Apparently MIT offers it&#39;s students an interest free $5000 loan. If every freshman at MIT took it out and put it into treasury bonds, they could get a free $1000 when they graduate.</p>
<h4>Saturday, Feb 10, 2024</h4>
<p>You can automatically switch the image type of an image on mac by going &quot;right click-&gt;quick actions-convert image&quot; in finder.</p>
<h4>Monday, Feb 5, 2024</h4>
<p>You can add /students to the url in canvas to see everyone that&#39;s registered for a class.</p>
<h4>Monday, Jan 29, 2024</h4>
<p>Aluminum is much harder to weld than steel, primarily because it conducts heat faster, and has a lower melting point. This gives you a smaller &quot;window of workability&quot;.</p>
<h4>Sunday, Jan 28, 2024</h4>
<p>New Hampshire is the only US state to have no laws requiring adults to wear seatbelts. However, in many other states (such as Massachusetts), it’s a “secondary offense”, which means you can’t get pulled over for not wearing one, but if you get pulled over for a primary infraction, you can get cited for not wearing a seatbelt.  </p>
<h4>Thursday, Jan 25, 2024</h4>
<p>The tallest oil platform is 2100 ft tall! It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronius_(oil_platform)">Petronius Compliant </a>tower, and is in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of it is under water though. </p>
<h4>Wednesday, Jan 24, 2024</h4>
<p>If clench my face really hard (kindof like I’m pooping), and wiggle my jaw, it works much better to clear my ears when I’m diving.</p>
<h4>Tuesday, Jan 23, 2024</h4>
<p>There’s this restaurant called Bali in Curacao that’s not worth going to.</p>
<h4>Monday, Jan 22, 2024</h4>
<p>If you don’t check in to your international flight more than 45 minutes before it leaves, they won’t let you on. On the upside, they can usually reschedule you for free. </p>
<h4>Sunday, Jan 21, 2024</h4>
<p>The front seat of a Uhaul cabin can fit 5 people if you really try.</p>
<h4>Saturday, Jan 20, 2024</h4>
<p>The building manager of The Stud (student center at MIT) is named Tim Woods and he can be pretty reasonable once you get to know him.</p>
<h4>Friday, Jan 19, 2024</h4>
<p>If you have a vertical plank of wood holding back water (ie, in a rectangular tank), the center of torque is at 1/3 the height of the water.</p>
<h4>Wednesday, Jan 10, 2024</h4>
<p>In economics, there’s this thing called the “productivity J curve”, where basically, after a new technology is discovered, “productivity” (as measured via GDP) will stagnate, because free capitol is being invested into the new technology (ie, building railroad lines, integrating AI infrastructure, etc). But then, once these shorter-term investments pay off, GPD rises faster again, overcoming the rate of decreased productivity. </p>
<h4>Tuesday, Jan 9, 2024</h4>
<p>There are two styles of cross country skiing. There’s “Classic”, where you mostly keep your skis parallel to each other, and mainly use your arms. Then there’s ”Skating”, where you point your toes outwards and drive yourself forwards by pushing your legs outwards. Classic is more intuitive, but generally requires better packed/more consistent snow.</p>
<h4>Monday, Jan 8, 2024</h4>
<p>Apparently Oxford has a secret “night climbers” club where people climb the walls + towers + roofs around Oxford. It seems to have a bigger focus on athleticism.</p>
<h4>Sunday, Jan 7, 2024</h4>
<p>The Estonian flag looks like the average landscape in Estonia: White snow, black trees, blue sky. Look it up, you’ll see what I mean!</p>
<h4>Saturday, Jan 6, 2024</h4>
<p>The ideal strategy in Ticket to Ride is probably to hoard cards at the beginning of the game (higher locomotives/card average, and you preserve optionality as long as possible). Also, start with game with fairly few tickets, and make sure they all can be linked together. People usually undervalue the utility of just building lots of roads and going out of trains. Also, in the EU version, Palermo to Moscow is the best long-route since that part of the board is much less crowded.</p>
<h4>Friday, Jan 5, 2024</h4>
<p>Apparently most countries other than the US have interest free investment accounts with <strong>no</strong> restrictions on what they can be used for (Canada has TFSA, UK has ISA). The limits are higher or comparable to in the US. The US has Roth IRA, but that has super strict limits on how you can withdraw from it, usually is just for retirement savings. </p>
<h4>Thursday, Jan, 4 2024</h4>
<p>Estonia, Finland, and maybe a few other countries are all in the same free-market energy pricing scheme. Due to extremely cold temperatures as well as less supply (I assume Russia/Ukraine stuff), energy prices are now such that running a small space heater for one day would cost ~€150. God bless America, and her oil. </p>
