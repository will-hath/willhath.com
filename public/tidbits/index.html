<h4>Friday, Jan 5 2024</h4>
<p>Apparently most countries other than the US have interest free investment accounts with <strong>no</strong> restrictions on what they can be used for (Canada has TFSA, UK has ISA). The limits are higher or comparable to in the US. The US has Roth IRA, but that has super strict limits on how you can withdraw from it, usually is just for retirement savings. </p>
<h4>Thursday, Jan 4 2024</h4>
<p>Estonia, Finland, and maybe a few other countries are all in the same free-market energy pricing scheme. Due to extremely cold temperatures as well as less supply (I assume Russia/Ukraine stuff), energy prices are now such that running a small space heater for one day would cost ~â‚¬150. God bless America, and her oil. </p>
